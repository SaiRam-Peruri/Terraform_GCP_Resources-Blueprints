# iam_binding.tf

## What is it?
Defines IAM policy bindings for GCP resources. IAM bindings assign roles to users, groups, or service accounts, controlling access to resources.

## Why use it?
IAM bindings are essential for enforcing least-privilege access, compliance, and auditability. They allow you to grant granular permissions to the right identities for each resource.

## How to use
- Set variables such as `resource`, `role`, and `members`.
- This module applies IAM bindings to a resource, enabling secure and auditable access control.

## How it's used in this project
This file provides a modular way to manage IAM bindings, supporting secure, compliant, and flexible access management for all GCP resources in your environment.
