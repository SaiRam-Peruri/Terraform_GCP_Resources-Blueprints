# ðŸš€ Terraform GCP Resources-Blueprints Deployment Guide

**Status:** âœ… Production-Ready & Tested  
**Infrastructure:** 40 Resources Successfully Deployed

This comprehensive guide will walk you through deploying a complete, production-grade GCP infrastructure using this fully refactored Terraform project.

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Prerequisites**

### **Software Requirements**
- [Terraform](https://terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.0
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) installed and configured
- Git for version control
- A text editor (VS Code recommended)

### **GCP Requirements**
- GCP Project with billing enabled
- Appropriate IAM permissions (Project Editor or custom roles)
- APIs will be automatically enabled by Terraform

### **Authentication**
Ensure you're authenticated with GCP:
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

---

## ðŸš€ **Quick Start (5 Minutes)**

### **1. Clone Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Terraform_GCP_Resources-Blueprints
```

### **2. Configure Variables**
Edit `terraform.tfvars` with your project details:
```hcl
# Required Variables
project_id = "your-gcp-project-id"
region     = "us-east4"
zone       = "us-east4-a"

# Resource Names (customize as needed)
project_name = "my-terraform-project"
vpc_name     = "my-vpc"
vm_name      = "my-vm"
bucket_name  = "your-unique-bucket-name"

# Service Account
sa_name = "my-service-account"

# Database
db_name = "my-first-db"
redis_tier = "BASIC"

# Monitoring
function_name = "my-first-cloud-function"
monitoring_host = "example.com"
alert_policy_display_name = "AppServer-Health-Check"
monitoring_display_name = "MyApp Monitoring"
monitoring_destination = "your-email@example.com"
monitoring_sink_name = "my-sink"
monitoring_uptime_check_name = "my-uptime-check"

# Secrets
secret_id = "my-secret"
secret_data = "my-secret-value"
```

### **3. Deploy Infrastructure**
```bash
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Review the deployment plan
terraform plan

# Deploy all resources
terraform apply
```

### **4. Verify Deployment**
```bash
# List all deployed resources
terraform state list

# Check specific resource details
terraform show

# View outputs
terraform output
```
   ```hcl
   project_id     = "your-gcp-project-id"
   region         = "us-east4"
   zone           = "us-east4-a"
   bucket_name    = "your-terraform-bucket"
   # ...and so on for all required variables
   ```
2. **(Optional)**: Review `variables.tf` in the root and modules for all available variables.

---

## 4. Initialize Terraform

```sh
terraform init
```
This will initialize the backend and download all required providers and modules.

---

## 5. Review the Plan

```sh
terraform plan
```
This will show you what resources will be created or changed.

---

## 6. Apply the Configuration

```sh
terraform apply
```
Type `yes` when prompted to approve the changes.

---

## 7. Monitor and Manage

- Use `terraform state list` to see all managed resources.
- Use `terraform destroy` to remove all resources (be careful!).
- Check the `documentation/` folder for detailed info on each module and resource.

---

## 8. Best Practices

- **Never commit secrets or state files to version control.**
- Use remote state for team collaboration.
- Review and update modules as GCP and Terraform evolve.
- Use the `outputs/` and `documentation/` folders for integration and reference.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

- If you see errors about missing buckets, ensure your backend bucket exists and is in the correct project.
- For API or permission errors, check your GCP IAM roles and enabled APIs.
- For module-specific issues, see the `documentation/` folder or open an issue in the repo.

---

## 10. Contributing

- Fork the repo and submit pull requests for improvements.
- Open issues for bugs or feature requests.
- See the `README.md` for project philosophy and structure.
