# ðŸš€ Getting Started with Terraform GCP Resource Library

This guide will help you set up, configure, and deploy this production-grade Terraform GCP resource library from scratch. Follow these steps to get your Google Cloud Platform infrastructure up and running quickly and safely.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed (v1.0+ recommended)
- [Google Cloud SDK (gcloud)](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) and [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install) installed
- A GCP project with billing enabled
- Sufficient IAM permissions to create resources and manage state

---

## 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd Terraform_GCP_Resources
```

---

## 2. Configure Backend for Remote State

1. **Create a GCS bucket for Terraform state:**
   ```sh
   gsutil mb -p <YOUR_PROJECT_ID> -l <YOUR_REGION> gs://<YOUR_BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME>
   ```
2. **Edit `backend.tf`** in the root folder to use your bucket name:
   ```hcl
   terraform {
     backend "gcs" {
       bucket  = "<YOUR_BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME>"
       prefix  = "terraform/state/provider"
     }
   }
   ```

---

## 3. Configure Variables

1. **Edit `terraform.tfvars`** to set your project, region, and resource names. Example:
   ```hcl
   project_id     = "your-gcp-project-id"
   region         = "us-east4"
   zone           = "us-east4-a"
   bucket_name    = "your-terraform-bucket"
   # ...and so on for all required variables
   ```
2. **(Optional)**: Review `variables.tf` in the root and modules for all available variables.

---

## 4. Initialize Terraform

```sh
terraform init
```
This will initialize the backend and download all required providers and modules.

---

## 5. Review the Plan

```sh
terraform plan
```
This will show you what resources will be created or changed.

---

## 6. Apply the Configuration

```sh
terraform apply
```
Type `yes` when prompted to approve the changes.

---

## 7. Monitor and Manage

- Use `terraform state list` to see all managed resources.
- Use `terraform destroy` to remove all resources (be careful!).
- Check the `documentation/` folder for detailed info on each module and resource.

---

## 8. Best Practices

- **Never commit secrets or state files to version control.**
- Use remote state for team collaboration.
- Review and update modules as GCP and Terraform evolve.
- Use the `outputs/` and `documentation/` folders for integration and reference.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

- If you see errors about missing buckets, ensure your backend bucket exists and is in the correct project.
- For API or permission errors, check your GCP IAM roles and enabled APIs.
- For module-specific issues, see the `documentation/` folder or open an issue in the repo.

---

## 10. Contributing

- Fork the repo and submit pull requests for improvements.
- Open issues for bugs or feature requests.
- See the `README.md` for project philosophy and structure.
