## 👋 About This Project & Author

Welcome! This is my flagship open-source project to showcase my expertise in Terraform and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure as code. As a passionate cloud engineer, I built this library to help teams, recruiters, and engineers accelerate their GCP journey with production-grade, modular, and fully-documented Terraform code.

- **Why this project?**
  - To demonstrate real-world, best-practice Terraform for GCP.
  - To help others learn, onboard, and deploy faster.
  - To contribute to the DevOps and cloud community with a gold-standard reference.

If you find this project useful, please star ⭐ the repo, share feedback, or connect with me!

# 🚀 Terraform GCP Resource Library

Welcome to a comprehensive, production-grade Terraform GCP resource library! This repository demonstrates advanced Terraform skills, modular design, and real-world best practices across 40+ Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. Every resource is organized for clarity, scalability, and ease of integration—making this repo a valuable reference for recruiters, DevOps teams, and cloud engineers.

---

## 🌟 Highlights

- **40+ GCP Services**: Modular Terraform code for networking, compute, IAM, serverless, storage, containers, monitoring, databases, security, DevOps, and more.
- **Production-Ready & Tested**: All modules are fully modular, use variables/outputs, and have been tested end-to-end in a real GCP environment.
- **Professional Structure**: Clean, logical folder organization for real-world projects. Each resource is in its own module, with variables and outputs separated for best practice.
- **Copilot-Accelerated**: GitHub Copilot was used to speed up initial file generation, with careful manual review and refinement for quality.
- **Documentation**: A dedicated `documentation/` folder explains every `.tf` file, its APIs, dependencies, and usage examples.
- **Quickstart Ready**: Includes a sample `terraform.tfvars` for fast onboarding and reproducible deployments.
